This script will take an input file of YouTube URLs and create an OPML file ready for importing into a newsreader.

To use from a Windows PC (change based on your variables):

1) Place the script below into C:\Test\ and name it PS_OPML.ps1 along with input.txt that contains your YouTube URLs.  

2) Start a Powershell session (Windows Key - X and choose Terminal)

3) Type cd \test and press enter

4 Type .\ps_opml.ps1 and press enter

5) The script will create an output.opml file that you can use to import into a newsreader. 

6) The script will also generate an errors.txt file if there are any.  You can refer to this to update your master list.
